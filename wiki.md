Wildfires are *uncontrolled fires* that burn in natural areas like forests and grasslands. They can be sparked by **lightning**, **human activity**, or **climate conditions**, and often spread rapidly due to wind and dry vegetation. While wildfires are often considered a natural part of ecosystems, sometimes their frequency and intensity can raise concerns about climate change, land management, and community resilience.

## Possible Causes of Wildfires

### Natural Causes
- Lightning strikes
- Volcanic activity
- Spontaneous combustion in dry conditions

### Human Causes
- Unattended campfires
- Cigarette butts
- Power line failures
- Arson

## Impact

### Environmental Effects
- Air pollution
- Loss of biodiversity
- Water contamination

### Human Consequences
- Evacuations
- Property damage
- Health risks
- Economic costs

## Prevention and Response
- **Controlled burns** to reduce fuel  
- **Firebreaks** to stop spread  
- **Aerial firefighting** with water and retardants
